# Getting familiar with relative units

Welcome to day 2 of the course!

There are no video lessons here today. These days are here to give you a chance to keep up if you fall behind, and also to provide some extra learning and resources for those who want to keep pushing.

Relative units
While you won't need to dive into relative units to get through this course, I do strongly suggest you learn how em and rem work, as they are essential in CSS today.

I have a [YT video on em and rem units](https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI), if you aren't already familiar with them, or if you struggle to know which one to use.

I also want to make sure that you completed the challenge. I'll be looking at the solution tomorrow, but I want to make sure you did it first, and this one shouldn't take you very long, so there are no excuses!

The easiest thing to do for them is to create a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

In CodePen, you can super easily get started by dragging the challenge files right into the browser window!

If you see a challenge and say "that's too easy!" make sure you actually do it anyway. It'll reinforce what was covered, and it's all building up skills we'll need to complete later challenges and help you conquer responsive [layouts](https://youtu.be/pautqDqa54I).
